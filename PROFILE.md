## Bio

I am 25 years old, born in Djibouti and moved to the UK at the age of 5. I have a background in microbiology and have recently transitioned into the data analysis field. I currently work as a Performance Analyst for Worcester Acute Hospital NHS Trust. My interests in technology began after landing my first role as a microbiologist. I quickly realised the impact that machine learning and automation could bring to the healthcare field and wanted to be involved in making that a reality.

## Education

I graduated from The *University of Birmingham* in 2020 with a degree in Biomdeical Science. 
I am currently completing a MSc Health Data Science at the same institution.

## Interests

My first love has always been literature and I hope to one day complete a creative writing course. More recently I have been delving into African and Carribean literary fiction. My favourites include:

1. August Town by Kei Miller
2. Their Eyes Were Watching God by Zora Neale Hurston
3. Beloved by Toni Morrison
4. Pachinko by Min Jin Lee
5. What It Means When a Man Falls from the Sky By Leslie Nneka Arimah

My favourite thing to watch when I need to relax is the Hamilton musical on Disney+:

My top five favourite shows are:

1. Modern Family
2. Vampire Diaries
3. Game of Thrones
4. This is Us
5. Grey's Anatomy

During this course, I would like to:

- Develop a solid understanding of web development
- Commit myself to attending all sessions and staying disciplined.
- Build interesting and useful projects.
- Network and foster meaningful relationships with coursemates and other Black women within the tech field.
- **Have fun!**
